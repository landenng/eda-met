# Exploratory Data Analysis of the Metropolitan Museum
The data used in this EDA is open access and available [here](https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess).

In this project, I am exploring the properties of the objects that the Metropolitan 
Museum of Art houses. Currently, I am working on analyzing the Greek and Roman 
department.
